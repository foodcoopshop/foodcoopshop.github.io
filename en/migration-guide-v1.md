### FCS v1.4.x to FCS v1.5
* replace source code => see bottom of page
* nothing else

### FCS v1.3.x to FCS v1.4

* The following settings moved from file-based configuration (app.config.php, custom.config.php) to the database:

* app.defaultCompensationPercentage => FCS\_DEFAULT\_VARIABLE\_MEMBER\_FEE\_PERCENTAGE
* Please update these configurations manually
