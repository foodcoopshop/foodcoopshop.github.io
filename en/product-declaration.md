## Product declaration

All food sold over the internet must have complete food labeling. That's what the legislator says.

In addition to a textual recording of this data, **an image can also be uploaded**. You can now, for example, Take a photo of the label and just upload it to the field **Long description** (product). It is also possible to use an existing image file of the label (for example in PNG format).

It is important that the indication of **price per unit** (basic price, eg cocktail tomatoes 250 g by 2 Euro (8 Euro / kg) is not forgotten.

How the image upload works exactly is described in [this doc to the WYSIWYG editor] ({{site.baseurl}}/en / wysiwyg-editor).

When ordering the image is then displayed automatically larger when you click on it.

If the product is sufficiently declared, please tick the box **Product declaration OK?**. With this check mark, the foodcoop (and also the manufacturer) can then understand which products have already been sufficiently declared and which are not.
